Word counter that uses tiny segmenter to tokenize japanese script
DeepL is also implemented but does not do a good job of translating words due to context
- Save words, frequency and translation to text file
- Enter translation manually for practice
- Single katakana and hiragana omitted for convenience. This can be removed by removing the appropriate regex
- Empty spaces, numbers, english words and symbols omitted.
